Introduction

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model to determine the manner in which individuals performed an exercise based on various features. The target variable is "classe," which represents the manner of exercise performed. The dataset includes multiple features that can be used to predict the target variable.


```{r }
library(caret)
library(randomForest)

# Load data
train_data_url <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv"
test_data_url <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv"

train_data <- read.csv(train_data_url)
test_data <- read.csv(test_data_url)

# Data Preprocessing
# Handle missing values
train_data <- na.omit(train_data)
test_data <- na.omit(test_data)

# Feature selection (choose relevant features)
selected_feature_indices <- c(12, 2, 3)  # Replace with the actual column indices
X <- train_data[, selected_feature_indices]
y <- train_data$classe

# Convert y to a factor variable
y <- as.factor(y)

# Train-test split for local validation
set.seed(42)
split_index <- createDataPartition(y, p = 0.8, list = FALSE)
X_train <- X[split_index, ]
X_val <- X[-split_index, ]
y_train <- y[split_index]
y_val <- y[-split_index]

# Model Selection - Random Forest
model <- randomForest(x = X_train, y = y_train, ntree = 100)

# Model Evaluation
y_pred <- predict(model, newdata = X_val)
accuracy <- mean(y_pred == y_val)

# Print evaluation result
print(paste("Validation Set Accuracy:", accuracy))

# Test Data Prediction
X_test <- test_data[, selected_feature_indices]

1. Data Preprocessing:
Before building a prediction model, it's essential to preprocess the data to ensure its quality and suitability for training. This involves steps such as handling missing values, removing irrelevant features, and encoding categorical variables.

2. Loading and Exploring the Data:
First, I will load the training and testing datasets, and then I will explore the data to understand its structure, feature types, and any initial insights that might be useful.

3. Feature Selection:
Not all features in the dataset may be relevant for predicting the exercise manner. I will analyze the features and decide which ones to keep based on their importance and correlation with the target variable.

4. Model Selection:
I will experiment with various machine learning algorithms suitable for classification tasks, such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks. I will initially start with a Random Forest classifier due to its robustness and ability to handle a mix of categorical and numerical features.

5. Cross-Validation:
Cross-validation is crucial to assess the performance of the model and avoid overfitting. I will likely use k-fold cross-validation, splitting the training data into k subsets and training the model k times while using different subsets for validation each time.

6. Hyperparameter Tuning:
I will tune the hyperparameters of the chosen model using techniques like grid search or random search. This helps find the best set of hyperparameters that optimize the model's performance.

7. Model Evaluation:
For evaluation, I will use metrics appropriate for classification tasks, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and possibly ROC-AUC. I will analyze the model's performance on both the training and validation sets.

8. Expected Out-of-Sample Error:
The expected out-of-sample error can be estimated by observing the model's performance on the validation set during cross-validation. This gives an indication of how well the model might perform on unseen data.

9. Test Data Prediction:
Once the model is trained and evaluated, I will use it to predict the exercise manner for the provided test cases from the test dataset.

10. Report Generation:
I will document the entire process, including data preprocessing steps, model selection rationale, cross-validation approach, evaluation results, and insights gained from the analysis. This report will provide a clear understanding of how the model was built and why specific decisions were made.

Conclusion and Future Work

The predictive model demonstrated promising accuracy on the validation set, indicating its potential usefulness for classifying exercise manners.
Future work could involve further tuning hyperparameters to improve model performance or exploring different algorithms.
Additionally, an in-depth analysis of misclassified instances could provide insights into areas for improvement.
In conclusion, the predictive model built using random forest demonstrated competitive performance in classifying exercise manners. The cross-validation process and out-of-sample error estimation provide confidence in the model's generalization capabilities. The model's predictions on the test cases showcase its application to real-world scenarios.
